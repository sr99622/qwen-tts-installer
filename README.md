This program configures and installs Qwen3-TTS on LInux equipped with NVIDIA GPU running CUDA, nvidia-smi required.

Create a Python virtual environment, activate it, then run this script to install Qwen3-TTS. The program will run nvidia-smi to determine your CUDA version, then coordinate the CUDA version with a prebuilt binary for flash attention using https://github.com/mjun0812/flash-attention-prebuild-wheels. Please sponsor Junya Morioka if you are using the binaries. You can enter your github token using the environment variable GITHUB_TOKEN to speed up this process.
